About a year and a half ago, I quit my dream new-grad job to found a startup with
a friend. Since then, it's been quite a tumultuous journey involving
reverse-engineering bank APIs, sneaking into conferences, several 
different pivots, and quite a lot of existential dread. Today, we're 
again mid-pivot. Being pre-PMF (product-market fit) for this long wears at your 
motivation and we're eager to make something work. 

I've always loved challenges and pushing for unrealistic deadlines so, in 
that spirit, I've decided to do the 75 Hard challenge but with a twist –
**we must hit $50k MRR by the end of it**. We work as hard and as long
as it takes to achieve this. I'm also going to incorporate 
some of the regular 75 Hard stuff (daily gym, good sleep hygiene, etc.)
but that's mostly uninteresting and won't report much on that. My version of 
"posting a picture everyday" will be writing an entry everyday here.

Let's go!

## Day 1

Thursday, April 17th, 2025

Did a planning session with David this morning. Summary: 
- All ideas from here on out will prioritize being (1) quick to validate 
and (2) quick to GTM (i.e. build and sell)
- We have to sell to small-to-mid-sized companies to hit the MRR goal. There isn't
a chance we can make it through an enterprise sales cycle in this timeframe
- We should focus on ideas that we have an edge in. This involves knowing or intimately 
knowing someone who knows the problem space well. The challenge is too short to
be in "exploration" mode for any extended period of time
- Growth hacks will be our best friend here. Generating inbound rather than
relying on outbound will move us towards the end-zone way faster

Tied up some loose project threads I was working on prior as well so I now have 
a clean slate. 

Here are some rough spaces we're considering going down:
- Audio AI: I've been working on converting an old ebook into an audiobook
using character voices from the show. Is this productizable? 
I've also fine-tuned nearly every open-source TTS model claiming SOTA.
Is there some niche audio task we can solve quickly?
- Tariffs: huge shift right now, could be value to capture here. David is going deep into 
this one. Can we help exporters do the compliance/paperwork necessary amidst the 
turbulent tariff situation? Need to talk to companies dealing with export between US and Canada. 
- Cash management/visibility: our last idea was in treasury. After talking to the former 
treasurer of a large cap public company, it's clear that the bank account situation of any mid-to-large-sized company is complex. 
With fragmentation of open-banking regulations, treasurers have teams of people
*just tracking balanaces and fees of bank accounts globally*. After reverse-engineering 
bank APIs, I think we might have a solution here... we will tap our treasury network
to validate this quickly.
- Cybersecurity and LLMs: reverse-engineering involves a lot of pattern recognition
and I've been approached a decent amount with projects here, some offering $$$.
Can LLMs be trained/prompted to be good at it? Can I get LLMs to solve CTFs reliably? 
If so, I think we're onto something. Can we build a pentesting agent? 
- Anti-piracy automation: I had this idea many years ago to automate DMCA takedown notices 
after one of my Patreon subs kept complaining about it

I'm currently most optimistic about cybersecurity and anti-piracy automation. Tariff 
stuff is cool too but not sure if we have any edge here, neither of us having much direct
experience. Will continue to tap the network on this, though.

Plan for tomorrow:
- Research cybersecurity and LLMs
- Research DMCA takedown notice stuff
- Tap network for more tariff ideas
- See if we can eval LLMs on a set of CTF problems

## Day 2

Friday, April 18th, 2025

Got a message from a friend at a startup asking for help 
reverse-engineering something. They would be willing to pay 
so this is a perfect time to try the whole LLM security angle. 
This is more app security than cloud security but still great to explore. 
Spent the entire day on this and it's still a WIP. Going to spend 
tomorrow as well on this and, if no luck, going to scrap. I can't
get pigeon-holed into a direction that is unlikely to pan for too long.

I also decided to scrap the audio AI direction. After some more thought,
most of my ideas come from thinking about building a cheaper/open-source version
of existing commercial services. This is great for open-source, less so for
building a business. I believe more value is to be built in applications of 
audio AI but I have no immediate ideas I'm excited about here. Also have 
some rough ideas around helping companies fine-tune agents and build reward models,
but that's very hazy – will table this direction for later.

Going to be heads down until tomorrow on app security stuff and come up for 
air after. Will revisit CTFs and anti-piracy/brand protection stuff after and 
David will continue on the tariffs and treasury threads.

Biggest worry right now is that all of our current threads will take too long to 
validate/build/start selling. Need to tap into things we have a network in.

## Day 3

Saturday, April 19th, 2025

Worked on the reverse-engineering job today with agents. While I think agents 
(esp. Claude Code) are amazing at pattern-matching and treating as oracles for 
obfuscated codebases, it seems quite hard to build a fully autonomous app security 
pentesting agent. I needed to guide Claude quite a bit and it seemed to struggle 
with Smali code. It also doesn't have a nice way to work with Ghidra or IDA Pro. 
That being said, it definitely sped me up and perhaps there is a tighter set of integrations
and a knowledge-base you can provide to make it really good.

All of that being said, I also realize that this sort of work feels more like 
"research". While I really enjoy research and open-ended work, we have a goal 
for these 75 days and the only way to hit the MRR target is to, as PG says, build something 
people want. In our case, this means either building something *we know* people want
or we can *quickly validate if people want* or not.

We have quite a few friends building startups, several of them doing very well.
Perhaps we should lean more into solving their problems? For example, friend 
I was reverse-engineering for explained that there weren't any good browser 
orchestration products for cleanly doing stuff like manually authenticating sessions, 
including Browserbase. This is an acute problem for them! I want to think about this more tomorrow.

Many of our ideas we don't directly have a network in so we have to have several
open-ended exploratory conversations before we can really judge the direction as 
fruitful or not. Perhaps we should just launch more? A well-executed launch 
creates a ton of inbound and quick feedback. Bookface is great and low-stakes. 

Sundays are good for thinking so plan is:
- Explore CTF agents
- Can we quickly create a pre-launch/waitlist for the DMCA takedown notice idea?
Are there any other lines we can cast concurrently?
- Explore Browserbase and the device/browser farm maintenance problem
- Explore tariff ideas
