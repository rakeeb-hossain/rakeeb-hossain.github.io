About a year and a half ago, I quit my dream new-grad job to found a startup with
a friend. Since then, it's been quite a tumultuous journey involving
reverse-engineering bank APIs, sneaking into conferences, several 
different pivots, and quite a lot of existential dread. Today, we're 
again mid-pivot. Being pre-PMF (product-market fit) for this long wears at your 
motivation and we're eager to make something work. 

I've always loved challenges and pushing for unrealistic deadlines so, in 
that spirit, I've decided to do the 75 Hard challenge but with a twist –
**we must hit $50k MRR by the end of it**. We work as hard and as long
as it takes to achieve this. I'm also going to incorporate 
some of the regular 75 Hard stuff (daily gym, good sleep hygiene, etc.)
but that's mostly uninteresting and won't report much on that. My version of 
"posting a picture everyday" will be writing an entry everyday here.

Let's go!

## Day 1

Thursday, April 17th, 2025

Did a planning session with David this morning. Summary: 
- All ideas from here on out will prioritize being (1) quick to validate 
and (2) quick to GTM (i.e. build and sell)
- We have to sell to small-to-mid-sized companies to hit the MRR goal. There isn't
a chance we can make it through an enterprise sales cycle in this timeframe
- We should focus on ideas that we have an edge in. This involves knowing or intimately 
knowing someone who knows the problem space well. The challenge is too short to
be in "exploration" mode for any extended period of time
- Growth hacks will be our best friend here. Generating inbound rather than
relying on outbound will move us towards the end-zone way faster

Tied up some loose project threads I was working on prior as well so I now have 
a clean slate. 

Here are some rough spaces we're considering going down:
- Audio AI: I've been working on converting an old ebook into an audiobook
using character voices from the show. Is this productizable? 
I've also fine-tuned nearly every open-source TTS model claiming SOTA.
Is there some niche audio task we can solve quickly?
- Tariffs: huge shift right now, could be value to capture here. David is going deep into 
this one. Can we help exporters do the compliance/paperwork necessary amidst the 
turbulent tariff situation? Need to talk to companies dealing with export between US and Canada. 
- Cash management/visibility: our last idea was in treasury. After talking to the former 
treasurer of a large cap public company, it's clear that the bank account situation of any mid-to-large-sized company is complex. 
With fragmentation of open-banking regulations, treasurers have teams of people
*just tracking balanaces and fees of bank accounts globally*. After reverse-engineering 
bank APIs, I think we might have a solution here... we will tap our treasury network
to validate this quickly.
- Cybersecurity and LLMs: reverse-engineering involves a lot of pattern recognition
and I've been approached a decent amount with projects here, some offering $$$.
Can LLMs be trained/prompted to be good at it? Can I get LLMs to solve CTFs reliably? 
If so, I think we're onto something. Can we build a pentesting agent? 
- Anti-piracy automation: I had this idea many years ago to automate DMCA takedown notices 
after one of my Patreon subs kept complaining about it

I'm currently most optimistic about cybersecurity and anti-piracy automation. Tariff 
stuff is cool too but not sure if we have any edge here, neither of us having much direct
experience. Will continue to tap the network on this, though.

Plan for tomorrow:
- Research cybersecurity and LLMs
- Research DMCA takedown notice stuff
- Tap network for more tariff ideas
- See if we can eval LLMs on a set of CTF problems

## Day 2

Friday, April 18th, 2025

Got a message from a friend at a startup asking for help 
reverse-engineering something. They would be willing to pay 
so this is a perfect time to try the whole LLM security angle. 
This is more app security than cloud security but still great to explore. 
Spent the entire day on this and it's still a WIP. Going to spend 
tomorrow as well on this and, if no luck, going to scrap. I can't
get pigeon-holed into a direction that is unlikely to pan for too long.

I also decided to scrap the audio AI direction. After some more thought,
most of my ideas come from thinking about building a cheaper/open-source version
of existing commercial services. This is great for open-source, less so for
building a business. I believe more value is to be built in applications of 
audio AI but I have no immediate ideas I'm excited about here. Also have 
some rough ideas around helping companies fine-tune agents and build reward models,
but that's very hazy – will table this direction for later.

Going to be heads down until tomorrow on app security stuff and come up for 
air after. Will revisit CTFs and anti-piracy/brand protection stuff after and 
David will continue on the tariffs and treasury threads.

Biggest worry right now is that all of our current threads will take too long to 
validate/build/start selling. Need to tap into things we have a network in.

## Day 3

Saturday, April 19th, 2025

Worked on the reverse-engineering job today with agents. While I think agents 
(esp. Claude Code) are amazing at pattern-matching and treating as oracles for 
obfuscated codebases, it seems quite hard to have a trully autonomous AppSec 
pentesting agent. I needed to guide Claude quite a bit and it seemed to struggle 
with Smali code. It also doesn't have a nice way to work with Ghidra or IDA Pro. 
That being said, it definitely sped me up and perhaps there is a tighter set of integrations
and a knowledge-base you can provide to make it really good.

All that being said, I realize that this sort of work feels more like 
"research". While I really enjoy research and open-ended work, we have a goal 
for these 75 days and the only way to hit the MRR target is to, as PG says, build something 
people want. In our case, this means either building something *we know* people want
or we can *quickly validate if people want* or not.

We have quite a few friends building startups, several of them doing very well.
Perhaps we should lean more into solving their problems? For example, friend 
I was reverse-engineering for explained that there weren't any good browser 
orchestration products for cleanly doing stuff like manually authenticating sessions, 
including Browserbase. This is an acute problem for them! I want to think about this more tomorrow.

Many of our ideas we don't directly have a network in so we have to have several
open-ended exploratory conversations before we can really judge the direction as 
fruitful or not. Perhaps we should just launch more? A well-executed launch 
creates a ton of inbound and quick feedback. Bookface is great and low-stakes. 

Sundays are good for thinking so plan is:
- Explore CTF agents
- Can we quickly create a pre-launch/waitlist for the DMCA takedown notice idea?
Are there any other lines we can cast concurrently?
- Explore Browserbase and the device/browser farm maintenance problem
- Explore tariff ideas

## Day 4

Sunday, April 20th, 2025

I mostly took today off but some notes from David:

Helping faciliate global commerce is an under-invested and very valuable area.
David is from Ireland. Ireland, being a small country, has always had to rely 
on global trade. The story of their economic success has been one of attracting 
FDI and supporting exports of Irish goods abroad. From speaking to treasurers 
and from direct experience, we're aware of some of the financial, tax, legal, compliance, 
and operational complexities of selling abroad. 
Stablecoins (for global payments) and LLMs (for automating back-office complexity)
have the potential to alleviate global commerce pains.
Can we make this easier in some pointed way that can give us traction quickly? 

A similar company in the space is a YC startup that is essentially "East Asia"-in-a-box.
They handle IP/trademark filings, legal enforcements of IP, and counterfeit monitoring. 
Very cool business and they seem to be doing quite well. 

Why now? Tariffs have companies looking into foreign sales with more scrutiny 
and many will likely be looking to cut costs. The global trade system is also 
undergoing a massive restructuring unlike anything we have seen over the last 
30 years — since the signing of NAFTA and the expansion of the WTO in the early 1990s

There is clearly a lot of value that can be created in this space. 
But, with any idea, we must first solve a very acute, specific, high-pain-point 
scenario that provides immediate value. We need to tap our network or mine for 
contacts that can work closely and casually with us. This is the only way we 
can hit our $50k MRR target.

Continuing with tariff and CTF direction tomorrow.

## Day 5

Monday, April 21st, 2025

Went deeper into CTFs and AI agents for red-teaming today. Quite bullish that 
there is a valuable company to be created here and that a simple AI agent 
wrapping Claude Sonnet and with retrieval over well-known vulnerabilities/attack 
patterns and tool-use over common security tools can probably solve a good chunk
of CTFs. This might be our MVP. 

Thought, we might be out of our depth here. I did reverse-engineer quite a bit of app 
and web code but network security is a whole different ball game. There are really 
technically strong teams working on this stuff like XBOW and Theori. That isn't a 
deterrant but rather gives me pause to think if we're the right team to build this. 
This is founder-market fit and something you hear a lot about in startup circles. 
It's not just my expertise but the *intersection* of my expertise with my co-founder's. 

Something exciting: RSA Conference (massive cybersecurity conference) is 
in SF starting next Monday. If we build and launch something this week, we can 
go hard on selling there. The question is what do we build that we can narrowly
execute on in time and what do we have a unique insight in. 

Some ideas:
- Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf for pen-testers. It's like having a really smart 
security engineer intern. No need to remind it that you're doing security work so
it shouldn't sensor. Capable of writing scripts, generating CTF-like attacks, 
and providing info on vulnerabilities. Has context on attacks you've tried so far.
Can ingest several common security formats natively (not sure what). 
Built-in integrations with oss-fuzz-gen, proxy services, etc.
Proofpoint would be CTF benchmarks and a nifty working demo.
- Keep track of new vulnerabilities, bug bounty reports, etc. with a simple Slackbot integration. It summarizes
reports from the various sources. This is stupid easy to build.
- Single URL attack surface monitor. You give us a domain, our agent crawls 
with amass, nmap, ffuf, subfinder. Summarize with a nice report on exposure. 
Can provide additional information to simulate a knowledgeable attacker, 
such as login credentials. 
Great for bug bounty hunters, red-teamers, and reverse-engineers.
- Code deobfuscation for app security. License check bypasses and cracking local 
software are insanely common. Use this to test against common tooling. 

Tomorrow:
- Meeting with YC batchmate who hired a security consultant and pentester to get 
an understanding of how the arrangement works (white-box, black-box, etc.)
- Get building on one of the security ideas for RSAC

## Day 6

Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025

Heads down on reverse-engineer AI agent for RSAC. David is sick so the non-cybersecurity 
threads will continue later. 

Trying to figure out what is a good deliverable/demo for the conference. Right now, the 
best idea I have is "give us a URL, we'll build map your API and find vulnerabilities".
This will involve fuzzing for common URL patterns, reading obfuscated JS, and backend
API recon. For red-teaming, this should be as discrete as possible, so rate-limit awareness
has to be builtin. At the end, a simple generated report would be nice. The interface 
for this will be a CLI app, similar to Claude Code.

Still a lot to think about here, will continue scoping and building out tomorrow.

## Day 7

Wednesday, April 23rd, 2025

Another day of heads-down building. I think if we do this right, 
we can get a great demo out of this and build a pretty damn useful product. 

I saw some fellow young founders launch products that have gotten quite a bit of buzz and
traction. This got me thinking about the different playbooks for GTM and validation for 
different types of founders. For founders with more experience (often older), they probably already 
have a semi-validated idea by experiencing it themselves so the playbook will likely 
involve selling into their own network. This lends itself to a slower, but more sustainable growth
model. Younger founders lack experience and are often naive but make up for it in understanding 
how to grab attention. Younger founders are often able to launch loudly and more publicly, 
such as through a buzzy Twitter post or a relatable TikTok-style "follow my life" series. 
In other words, younger founders are more in-tune with content creation and can use this to 
their advantage to generate buzz. This can get ideas validated quickly and build traction. Churn 
will likely be high. They then have to grapple with how to turn this into sustainable growth. 

Almost without fail, every fellow young founder I've seen succeed follows some variation of this 
playbook. I'd argue that the ones that don't are playing a losing game – one which older founders 
dominate due to superior experience and networks. 

I think we've fallen into that category: young founders who try to approach starting startups 
with a more careful and thesis-based approach (i.e. thinking about what we think the world will be 
like in 5 years). It feels closer to how Peter Thiel describes coming up with Palantir.
However, we're too inexperienced for this and lack the network. To hit the 75 Hard target we need to 
swing in the other direction, launch loudly and quickly, and trust ourselves to shape early traction 
into something we're long-term excited about.
