About a year and a half ago, I quit my dream new-grad job to found a startup with
a friend. Since then, it's been quite a tumultuous journey involving
reverse-engineering bank APIs, sneaking into conferences, several 
different pivots, and quite a lot of existential dread. Today, we're 
again mid-pivot. Being pre-PMF (product-market fit) for this long wears at your 
motivation and we're eager to make something work. 

I've always loved challenges and pushing for unrealistic deadlines so, in 
that spirit, I've decided to do the 75 Hard challenge but with a twist –
**we must hit $50k MRR by the end of it**. We work as hard and as long
as it takes to achieve this. I'm also going to incorporate 
some of the regular 75 Hard stuff (daily gym, good sleep hygiene, etc.)
but that's mostly uninteresting and won't report much on that. My version of 
"posting a picture everyday" will be writing an entry everyday here.

Let's go!


## Day 1

Did a planning session with David this morning. Summary: 
- All ideas from here on out will prioritize being (1) quick to validate 
and (2) quick to GTM (i.e. build and sell)
- We have to sell to small-to-mid-sized companies to hit the MRR goal. There isn't
a chance we can make it through an enterprise sales cycle in this timeframe
- We should focus on ideas that we have an edge in. This involves knowing or intimately 
knowing someone who knows the problem space well. The challenge is too short to
be in "exploration" mode for any extended period of time
- Growth hacks will be our best friend here. Generating inbound rather than
relying on outbound will move us towards the end-zone way faster

Tied up some loose project threads I was working on prior as well so I now have 
a clean slate. 

Here are some rough spaces we're considering going down:
- Audio AI: I've been working on converting an old ebook into an audiobook
using character voices from the show. I've encountered the whole gambit of
audio analysis and editing tools: stem separation, enhancement, diarization,
text-to-speech, speech-to-text, SVC, etc. I've become intimately familiar 
with the space and I've fine-tuned nearly every modern TTS model claiming SOTA. 
It's clear that this space is actively developing and quite fragmented (aside from ElevenLabs).
*There HAS to be a niche product or audience in need of better audio AI tools*. TBD.
- Tariffs: huge shift right now, could be value to capture here. David is going deep into 
this one. Can we help exporters do the compliance/paperwork necessary amidst the 
turbulent tariff situation? Need to talk to companies dealing with export between US and Canada. 
- Cash management/visibility: this one I'm fairly confident is a good idea. 
After talking to the former treasurer of a large cap public company, it's clear
that the account structure of any mid-to-large-sized company is complex. 
With fragmentation of open-banking regulations, treasurers have teams of people
*just tracking balanaces and fees of bank accounts globally*. After reverse-engineering 
bank APIs, I think we might have a solution here... we will tap our treasury network
to validate this quickly.
- Cybersecurity and LLMs: reverse-engineering involves a lot of pattern recognition.
Can LLMs be trained/prompted to be good at it? Can I get LLMs to solve CTFs reliably? 
If so, I think we're onto something. Can we build a pentesting agent? 

While it's fresh on my mind, decided to think more on audio AI...

Plan for tomorrow:
- Research cybersecurity and LLMs
- By early afternoon, have something concrete to work on/build/validate
